# [Project 1: Exploratory Visualization](https://sheri-kamal.github.io/DATA73200-SP2020/Exploratory/)

## [Prospectus](https://github.com/sheri-kamal/DATA73200-SP2020/tree/master/Exploratory)
For my project, I will be exploring 311 data for NYC. More specifically, I will be exploring water quality complaints across NYC from 2010 to 2019. This exploration allows us to take a look at the major water quality issues in NYC and which boroughs are more impacted by water quality issues in NYC. This exploration could prove useful to help city and government agencies, specifically the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), to determine which areas are in need of water quality improvement and to determine what specifically needs to be improved.

## [Sketches and Mockups](https://github.com/sheri-kamal/DATA73200-SP2020/blob/master/Exploratory/Sketches%20and%20Mockups.png)
With this data,  there are several types of visualizations that come to mind, but the one that stands out immediately is a bar chart showing the number of complaints for each descriptor type. Another type of visualization that comes to mind is a pie chart showing the number of complaints by borough. A final type of visualization that I would consider is a simple map that shows where the complaint was filed.

## [Architectural Schema](https://github.com/sheri-kamal/DATA73200-SP2020/blob/master/Exploratory/Architectural%20Schema.png)
The layout of the visualization will be a dashboard made up of two charts and a legend so there will be a need for three svg containers. The charts, a bar chart and a pie chart, will update on mouseover as will the legend to show the number of water quality complaints and the percentage of total complaints by borough.

## [Final Data](https://github.com/sheri-kamal/DATA73200-SP2020/blob/master/Exploratory/Final%20Dataset.csv)
This dataset contains the following variables:
  * Complaint 
  * Borough 
  * Count
