This visualization is a dashboard made up of a bar chart, a pie chart, and a legend. It was created to explore various water quality complaints in New York City from 2010 to 2019. If you hover over a bar the pie chart and legend updates to show the borough breakdown of that water quality complaint. If you hover a borough pie slice the bar chart updates to show the water quality complaint breakdown for that borough. This visualization shows us which boroughs have the most water quality complaints and the type of water quality complaints each borough make the most.
